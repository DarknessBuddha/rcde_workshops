> ## 1. What services does Cloud offer?
> 
> - Before we can evaluate the necessity of moving to the cloud, we need to 
> to know what services are available. 
>   - SaaS: Software-as-a-Service
>   - PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service
>   - IaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service
> - Vendor: cloud service provider. 
{:.slide}


> ## 2. SaaS: Software-as-a-Service
> 
> - Vendor controlled applications that are accessed over the network by users.
> - Characteristics:
>   - Network-based access
>   - Multi-tenancy
>   - Single software release for all
> - Examples:
>   - Applications in the Google Suite
>   - Dropbox
>   - Cisco WebEx
>
{:.slide}


> ## 3. SaaS: Application Design
> 
> - Net native
>   - Cloud-specific design, development, and deployment
>   - Multi-tenant data
>   - Built-in metering and management
>   - Browser-based
>   - Customization via configuration
> - High degree of configurability, efficiency, and scalability
>
{:.slide}


> ## 4. SaaS: Disadvantages
> 
> - SaaS providers are dependent on network and cloud service providers.
>   - [A Dropbox story](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/)
> - Performance is dependent on individual client's bandwidth.
> - Security
>   - Good: Better security than personal computers
>   - Bad: SaaS vendors (and cloud providers) are in charge of the data
>   - Ugly: Privacy
>
{:.slide}


> ## 4. SaaS and Privacy
> 
> - Who owns your data in SaaS?
> - [Google Drive ToS](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2450387?hl=en)
>
{:.slide}


> ## 5. SaaS and Privacy
> 
> - Who has access to your data in SaaS?
> - [Google ToS](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en&gl=us)
>
{:.slide}


> ## 6. PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service
> 
> - Vendors provide development environment.
>   - Tools and technologies are selected by vendors.
>   - Users maintain control over data (application) life-cycle.
> - Examples:
>   - Google App Engine
>   - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
>   - Heroku
>
{:.slide}


> ## 7. PaaS: Architectural characteristics
> 
> - Support multi-tenancy at various scale: sessions, processes, and data.
>   - Isolation at: physical, virtual, and logical levels
>   - [Microsoftâ€™s offerings of isolation choices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/isolation-choices)
> - Native scalability
>   - Load balancing and fail-over (AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
> - Native integrated management
>   - Performance
>   - Resource consumption/utilization
>   - Load
>
{:.slide}


> ## 7. PaaS: Disadvantages
> 
> - Inherits all from SaaS
> - Options on technologies and tools are limited by the PaaS vendors
>
{:.slide}


> ## 8. IaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service
> 
> - Vendors provide computing resources.
> - Users provision computing resources.
>   - Compute resources include processing, storage, memory, network etc.
>   - Users are provided with customized virtual machines.
> - Users maintain control over:
>   - Operating system, memory
>   - Storage,
>   - Servers and deployment configurations, and
>   - Some limited control over network resources via software-defined networking
>
{:.slide}


> ## 8. IaaS: Advantages
> 
> - Infrastructure scalability
> - Native-integrated management via vendors' utilities
>   - Performance, resource consumption/utilization, load
> - Economical cost
>   - Hardware, IT support
>
{:.slide}


> ## 9. IaaS: Disadvantages
> 
> - Require more technical efforts than SaaS and PaaS.

> ## 12. XaaS: Everything-as-a-Service
> 
> - Composite second level services

> ## 13. NIST: Four deployment models
> 
> - Private Cloud
> - Community Cloud
> - Public Cloud
> - Hybrid Cloud
>
{:.slide}


> ## 14. Private cloud
> 
> - Infrastructure is organized solely for an organization
> - Infrastructure is managed by the organization or by a third party
>
{:.slide}


> ## 15. Community cloud
> 
> - Supports a specific community
> - Infrastructure is shared by several organizations
> - Examples: CloudLab
>
{:.slide}


> ## 16. Public cloud
> 
> - Infrastructure is made available to the general public
> - Infrastructure is owned by an organization selling cloud services
> - Example: Azure Notebook free tier. 
>
{:.slide}


> ## 17. Hybrid cloud
> 
> - Infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds deployment models.
> - Enables data and application portability
>
{:.slide}


> ## 18. Cloud Security: who is doing what
> 
> - The cloud provider is responsible for the security **OF** the Cloud.
> - The cloud consumer (users) is responsible for the security **IN** the Cloud.
>
{:.slide}


> ## 19. Cloud consumer
> 
> - SaaS/PaaS:
>   - Standard security procedure for online presences.
> - IaaS:
>   - Standard security procedure as any on-premise infrastructures.
>   - Benefits from native administrative tools from the Cloud Provider.
{:.slide}


> ## 20. Cloud provider: SaaS security
>
> - SaaS:
>   - Web application security: [OWASP's Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
>   - Multi-tenancy: data isolation/leakage
>   - Data security: accessibility versus security trade-off
>
{:.slide}


> ## 21. Cloud provider: PaaS security
>
> - Similar security concerns as SaaS
> - Complex security schemes due to potential third-party relationships.
> - Development Lifecycle
>   - Users depend on PaaS providers to patch security issues of the individual tools.
>
{:.slide}


> ## 22. Cloud provider: IaaS security
>
> - Standard security measures.
>   - To Cloud Provider, cloud resources are on-premise.
> - Concerns with virtual machines' security
> - Concerns with virtual networking security
