## General Policy


```{dropdown} Excused Absences Policy

:::{dropdown} 1. University Sanctioned Events Policy
Students participating in participating in University sanctioned events such
as, but not limited to, the Marching Band, musical ensembles, theatre group,
athletic events, forensics competition, etc., will be granted an excused
absence for class periods missed. Students will be granted the privilege of
taking, at an alternative time to be determined by the professor, scheduled
examinations or quizzes that will be missed. I will designate such times prior
to the event and reserve the right to provide a fair alternative to taking the
examination or quiz that will be missed. Students must submit original
documentation on University letterhead signed by the activity director, coach,
or adviser detailing the specifics of the event in advance. Specific
requirements include:

1. Responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student.
2. Students are expected to notify their professors as soon as they know they
will be missing class due to a University sanctioned event.
3. Students are expected to complete the work requirement for each class and
turn in assignments due on days of the event prior to their due dates unless
other arrangements are made with myself.
4. If a scheduled event is postponed or canceled, the student is expected to
go to class.
5. Students are not excused from classes for practice on nonevent days.

The following are specifics for the student athlete:
1. The student athlete is expected, where possible, to schedule classes on
days and at hours that do not conflict with athletic schedules.
2. Athletes are not excused from classes for practice or training-room
treatment on nongame days.
:::

:::{dropdown} 2. Military Services

West Chester University recognizes required (non-voluntary) service in the United 
States military including the Pennsylvania National Guard as a legitimate reason 
to miss up to the equivalent of 2 weeks during a 15-week semester. Service members 
must submit a copy of their orders to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office 
will communicate with respective faculty members and the student will be granted an 
excused absence(s) for the class periods missed. All points covered in part I of this 
policy including make-up work and specific requirements 1-4 also apply. Service members 
required to miss more than the equivalent of 2 weeks during a 15-week semester can 
withdraw from the term in a non-punitive manner in accordance with Pennsylvania state 
law. Students are expected to work closely with faculty and the Registrar’s Office to 
ensure their academic success. Students in programs with external accrediting bodies 
must also be aware that there may be attendance requirements that cannot be made up.

:::

:::{dropdown} 3. Medical Emergency

In the event of a student's unplanned medical emergency, including serious 
health conditions as outlined in the Family and Medical Leave Act, or the 
death of a student's immediate family member, faculty members are expected 
to provide, within reason, an opportunity for students to make up work. 
Students are responsible for providing proper documentation and will work 
with respective faculty members to make up course work as described in part 
I of this policy. Students are encouraged to contact Student Assistance for 
additional information.

:::

:::{dropdown} 4. Family and Medical Leave Act

Consistent with guidelines set forth by the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
students who become parents of new children or have children with serious 
health conditions that require the student-parent to miss up to the 
equivalent of 2 weeks during a 15-week semester shall be given an excused 
absence for the courses that are missed. Students will work with respective 
faculty members to make up course work as described in part I of this 
policy. Students required to miss more than the equivalent of 2 weeks 
during a 15-week semester can withdraw from the term up until the 
term-withdraw deadline. Students required to miss more than one semester 
should also refer to Admissions policy on consecutive non-enrollment. 
Students are encouraged to contact Student Assistance for additional information.

:::

:::{dropdown} 5. Federal and State Legal Statutes 

West Chester University recognizes excused absences in accordance with 
federal and state legal statutes including but limited to compliance with

writing from your smart phone. Always proofread your emails before sending.
- **Email Account**:	I do not care which email account you send email from, as
long as it is clearly addressed and signed so that I know who you are. But
please be advised to appropriately link the email that you wish to use with
myWCU and D2L; I will be using those services to send out emails to the
entire class. It is your responsibility to make sure this is configured
correctly so that you receive my emails.
```

```{dropdown} Computer Science Department Dishonesty Policy:
The Computer Science Committee has adopted the following policies in regard
to academic dishonesty in Computer Science classes:
1. A student found to be academically dishonest in an assignment will receive
zero for that assignment if it is his/her first offense in that class [the
course, not the class period], but an F for the course if it is for his/her
second offense in that class [the course].
2. A student found to be academically dishonest in a test will receive the
grade of F in that class [the course].
3. For the purposes of this document on academic dishonesty, every form or
method of evaluation in a class will be considered as being of one of two
types: an assignment or a test. Assignments include homework assignments, and
short quizzes [and labs]. Tests include final exams and major exams. An
instructor has, subject to these guidelines, the discretion to determine the
type of any other form of evaluation, such as a project, in his/her class.
4. A student who has received the grade of F in a course because of academic
dishonesty and who wants or is required to repeat that course may re-take
that course only as a regularly scheduled course that is open to the student
community in general. In exceptional circumstances, this condition may be
revoked, but only by an explicit action to that effect by the full Computer
Science Committee, and only then on a case by case basis.
5. The term academic dishonesty is used throughout in the sense provided by
the rules and regulations of West Chester University. The following is taken
from The Ram's Eye View of 1997-1998: **“Academic dishonesty as it applies to
students includes but is not limited to academic cheating; plagiarism; the
sale, purchase, or exchange of term papers or research papers; falsification
of information which includes any form of providing false or misleading
information, written, electronic, or oral; or of altering or falsifying
official institutional records. Plagiarism is defined as copying another's
work or portion thereof and/or using ideas and concepts of another and
presenting them as one's own without giving proper credit to the source.”**
```


```{dropdown} No-Grade, Violation of Academic Integrity, and Violation of Student Code of Conduct Policy:
For questions regarding Academic Dishonesty, the No-Grade policy, Sexual
Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer
to their major department’s handbook, the Undergraduate Course Catalogue, the
Rams Eye View, or the University Web Site. Please understand that improper
conduct in any of these areas will not be tolerated and may result in
immediate ejections from the class.
```


```{dropdown} ADA Policy:
If you have a disability that requires accommodations under the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), please present your letter of accommodations
and meet with me as soon as possible so that I can support your success in
an informed manner. Accommodations cannot be granted retroactively. If you
would like to know more about West Chester University’s Services for Students
with Disabilities (OSSD), please contact the OSSD which is located at 223
Lawrence Center. The OSSD hours of Operation are
Monday – Friday 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Their phone number is 610-436-2564,
fax number is 610-436-2600, and their email address is [ossd@wcupa.edu](mailto:ossd@wcupa.edu).

the [OSSD website](http://www.wcupa.edu/ussss/ossd).

In an effort to assist students who either receive or may believe they are 
entitled to receive accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the University has appointed 
a student advocate to be a contact for students who have questions regarding the 
provision of their accommodations or their right to accommodations. The advocate 
will assist any student who may have questions regarding these rights. The Director 
for Equity and Compliance/Title IX Coordinator has been designated in this role. 
Students who need assistance with their rights to accommodations should contact 
them at 610-436-2433.
```

```{dropdown} Reporting Incidents of Sexual Violence:
West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and 
productive educational environment for all students. In order to comply with the 
requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the University’s 
commitment to offering supportive measures in accordance with the new regulations 
issued under Title IX, the University requires faculty members to report incidents 
of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator. 
The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents 
of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a 
writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. 
Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student 
who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred 
to the person designated in the University Protection of Minors Policy. Information 
regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims 
of sexual violence is set forth at: https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/sexualMisconduct/default.aspx
```


```{dropdown} Inclusive learning environment and anti-racist statement
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to West Chester University’s mission 
as reflected in our [Mission Statement, Values Statement, Vision Statement](https://www.wcupa.edu/president/missionStatement.aspx), and [Strategic 
Plan: Pathways to Student Success](https://www.wcupa.edu/president/strategicPlan/default.aspx). 
We disavow racism and all actions that silence, 
threaten, or degrade historically marginalized groups in the U.S. We acknowledge that all 
members of this learning community may experience harm stemming from forms of oppression 
including but not limited to classism, ableism, heterosexism, sexism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, 
and xenophobia, and recognize that these forms of oppression are compounded by racism. 

Our core commitment as an institution of higher education shapes our expectation for behavior 
within this learning community, which represents diverse individual beliefs, backgrounds, 
and experiences. Courteous and respectful behavior, interactions, and responses are expected 
from all members of the University. We must work together to make this a safe and productive 
learning environment for everyone. Part of this work is recognizing how race and other aspects of 
who we are shape our beliefs and our experiences as individuals. It is not enough to condemn acts 
of racism. For real, sustainable change, we must stand together as a diverse coalition against racism 
and oppression of any form, anywhere, at any time. 

Resources for education and action are available through WCU’s [Office for Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion (ODEI)](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/changeBeginsHere.aspx), 
DEI committees within departments or colleges, the student [ombudsperson](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/STU/studentOmbuds/), and 
centers on campus committed to doing this work (e.g., [Dowdy Multicultural Center](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/multicultural/), 
[Center for Women and Gender Equity](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/stu.wce/), 
and the [Center for Trans and Queer Advocacy](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/transAndQueer/)). 

Guidance on how to report incidents of discrimination and harassment is available at the University’s 
[Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/).
