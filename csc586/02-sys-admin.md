# Linux System Administrators


```{dropdown} 1. Essential duties of a Linux system aministrator (sysadmin)
 
- Controlling Access
- Adding Hardware
- Automating Tasks
- Overseeing Backups
- Installing and Upgrading Software
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting
- Maintaining Local Documentation
- Vigilantly Monitoring Security
- Tuning Performance
- Developing Site Policies
- Working With Vendors
- Fire Fighting

```

```{dropdown} 2. Controlling access     
 
- Create new user accounts
- Remove expired accounts
- Handle all account-related issues
  - Access control

```

```{dropdown} 3. Adding hardware    
 
- Adding/removing physical components from the system
- Installing/configuring corresponding hardware drivers

```

```{dropdown} 4. Automating tasks    
 
- Leverage script programming (scripting) and Linux/Unix system commands to automate 
repetitive and time-consuming tasks. 
 - Reduce human errors
 - Improve response time
 - Indispensable to adminstrating and managing large cluster of computers. 
- Example script installing and configuring Docker for all user accounts on CloudLab:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/060f8a99fbc3666b6abf8f05be54a28c.js?file=install_docker.sh"></script>

```

```{dropdown} 5. Overseeing backup     
 
- Computing systems **will** fail. 
- Large computing systems will **fail frequently**.
- Backup is time consuming, tedious, and **highly critical**. 
  - Should be automated!

```

```{dropdown} 6. Installing and upgrading software     
 
- Installing software as needed.
- Upgrading/patching security holes of existing software as needed.
  - Juggling multiple versions of same software. 
- Manage software to manage installed software.

```

```{dropdown} 7. Monitoring

- Help identifying issues related to the computing systems. 
  - Collecting and analyzing log files
  - Monitoring resource avaiability (CPU and memory utilization, storage availability,)

```{dropdown} 8. Hands-on: Getting started

- SSH to `molly`. Refer to the Setup page if you need a refresher on how to 
do so.
- Run the following commands to observe the system.
  - The `$` is not meant to be typed into the terminal. 
  - It implies that the rest of the command (`htop` in this case) is to be typed 
  into a terminal. 

~~~
$ htop
~~~

```


```{dropdown} 9. Troubleshooting

- The sysadmin identifies the issue via monitoring or users' complaints
- The sysadmin needs to fix the issue. 

```


```{dropdown} 10. Maintaining local documentation

- Overtime, computing systems will become customized according to the preferences and 
styles of their current sysadmins. 
  - Software vendors
  - Deployment methods
  - Automation scripts
- It is critical that sysadmins maintain detailed documentations so that **you** and others 
can understand/remember how the systems worked (and evolved) for maintenance and upgrade 
purposes. 

```


```{dropdown} 11. Vigilantly monitoring security

- Attempts within 12 hours on `molly`:
  - This is only the most naive type of hacking attempts, there are others. 
- Exercise:
  - Visit https://www.iplocation.net
  - Find out where are these IP addresses located.

```


```{dropdown} 12. Tuning performance

- Based on system monitors, sysadmins can, and should, configure 
system components (operating system configurations, software-specific configuration) 
in order to improve usersâ€™ application performance. 
- In many cases, sysadmins need to work with users to ensure that users apply 
application-specific run-time configuration to ensure optimal performance. 

```


```{dropdown} 13. Developing site policies

- The main responsibility of sysadmins are to deploy and maintain complex 
computing systems that support a diverse set of applications and users. 
- This includes developing appropriate documents regarding:
  - Acceptable use of computer systems
  - Management and retention of data
  - Privacy and security of networks and systems
  - Adherence to regulation (local and governmental)
  - Anything specifics  that you want (hope) the users to follow ...

```


```{dropdown} 14. Working with vendors

- Be the liaison between vendors and the institutions (businesses). 
  - Hardware vendors
  - Software vendors
  - Cloud providers

```


```{dropdown} 15. Fire fighting 

- On-the-fly troubleshooting of critical issues
  - Most of the time user-related
  - Critical patching of security issues (outside of normal maintenance schedule)

```


```{dropdown} 16. Relevant Tools

- Highly comfortable with keyboard (say goodbye to the mouse)
- Know your environment (laptop)
- Text editors: nano or vim
- Scripting: bash (or Python or Ruby)

```


```{dropdown} 17. Specialization and related areas of emphasis

- DevOps
- Site-reliability engineers
- Security operations (SecOps) engineers
- Network administrators
- Database administrators
- Network operations center (NOC) engineers
- Data center technicians
- System architects

```
